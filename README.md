# Random-based algorithmic music generation in Python
- requires Mark Conway Wirt's MidiFile.py, which can be found on https://github.com/MarkCWirt/MIDIUtil
- running main.py writes a MIDI file "demo.mid" in the executing directory
- an output example is provided in the repository as "perky_python.mid" or in form of a fully WAV-rendered and mastered version on https://soundcloud.com/arrow-3/the-perky-python
- for playing MIDI files I recommend using the soundfont SGM v2.01, that can be downloaded at http://www.mediafire.com/file/zo8l3dgf2989266/SGM-V2.01.7z (unfortunately it does not seem to be downloadable from the authors website http://www.geocities.jp/shansoundfont/ anymore). For a detailed description of how to play MIDI files using soundfonts, see http://www.informatics-tech.com/how-to-make-midi-files-sound-better.html
