# musipy
- random-based algorithmic music generation in python
- requires Mark Conway Wirt's MidiFile.py, which you can find on https://github.com/MarkCWirt/MIDIUtil
- running main.py writes a MIDI file "demo.mid" in the executing directory
- an output example is given by "demo.mid"
- for playing MIDI files I recommend using the soundfont SGM v2.01, that can be downloaded at http://www.mediafire.com/file/zo8l3dgf2989266/SGM-V2.01.7z (unfortunately it does not seem downloadable from the authors website http://www.geocities.jp/shansoundfont/ anymore). A detailed description of how to use soundfont files to play MIDI files, can be read here: http://www.informatics-tech.com/how-to-make-midi-files-sound-better.html For the lazy ones I also provide a WAV-rendered version on https://soundcloud.com/arrow-3/the-perky-python
